I",<p>This is a project for HIS 363E: Mapping Latin America at UT Austin. In this course, we have spent the semester analyzing various historical maps of the geographic area referred to as ‘Latin America.’
This project seeks to understand my own perception of Latin America through the fiction and non-fiction works I’ve read concerning the area. I am doing this by creating maps of the works
I have read that concern Latin America and the Latinx Identity. On these maps, I am shading in countries where I have read something concerning the nation.</p>
